It was a beautiful day as winter slid into spring. The birds were singing, whenever the birds sang it meant that it was safe. This is what the vehicle commander kept telling himself in an attempt to bring about a sense of security, even though it probably was not true. The wind was carrying the scent of wet mud across the fields of budding wheat. The farmers were in their fields, toiling against the weeds and stoppages in the irrigation, it was non-stop work. You could often see their lights well into the night. The squad was on a simple quick run to the outpost to drop off replacement computer cables to the Command Outpost or COP they had just established in the center of the city. The wind, rain, dust, and the harshness of living out of the vehicles in the midst of the austere desert environment was very hard on the sensitive electronic equipment. All of their equipment was either broken or breaking.  

The trees were beginning to bud along the road that led to the small villages’ bazaar. It was almost spring and that meant it was getting closer to going home; at least closer than yesterday. As they drove down the road children began pouring out of their huts in the hopes that the Marines would hand them an MRE or piece of candy. The vehicle commander ordered his driver to slow the vehicle over the vehicle's intercom. He had seen a boy no older than four run over during a previous deployment and had no desire to repeat that incident. Somehow the boy had survived, his destiny was not to die that day; maybe he would discover the cure for cancer or more than likely he would blow himself up in a small market in the name of a holy war against the infidels. 

Most people, including himself, would describe him as an optimist but this war messes with ones head till you are not sure what you think anymore.
“When did I become such a pessimist?” Second Lieutenant Andor Kellogg said out loud without realizing it.

“Excuse me Sir?” replied the driver snapping the Lieutenant from his trance.

“Oh nothing Corporal. Just thinking out loud. Go ahead and slow it down a bit. Don’t want to run over any kids today.” 

“Aye aye sir.” replied the Corporal as he took his foot off the gas.

They were riding in an armored beast of a truck known as Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All Terrain Vehicle or M-ATV. They offered a much higher survivability rate if they were to be attacked than say a Humvee. The entire company was lucky to be outfitted with them. 

The children swarmed up to the edge of the road and stared expectantly at the Marines behind the bullet and explosion resistant glass. 
It was amazing how these people scratched out what some would call an existence along the banks of the river that cut through a mighty desert that had swallowed the Mongol hoards and before them the armies of Alexander the Great. 

The gunner manning  the M2 Browning .50 caliber machine gun mounted in the turret on top of the vehicle, was the only Marine exposed and he reached into his cargo pocket and tossed a handful of Werther’s Originals to the kids lining the road. There was a mad dash for the candy. One young girl caught Kellogg’s eye. Her smile so full of joy, it reminded him of his younger sister.[1] The girl who could have been no older than four or five hurriedly bent over to collect the candy. 

Who decided who was born where and with what opportunities? 

If it was God one could not help but think he was cruel. That girl would grow up only to be sold like cattle as a wife to the highest bidder. She would probably be forbidden to go to school, and if she dared to she would mostly likely be killed or worse be burned with acid for her crime… 

Now how is that for chance? Geez I am such a pessimist! I have to stop thinking like that.

“Watch your dispersion as we pass through the village.” Kellogg said over the radio. There were four vehicles in the resupply convoy. Kellogg keyed the mike to make a joke but there was a man coming out of the mosque and something did not look right. Kellogg hit the switch to the intercom.

“Watch the right. Brown burka coming out of the mosque.”

The gunner swiveled and trained the machine gun on the individual. They were approaching fast. The man broke into a run towards the vehicle and raised his arms above his head.

“Gunner engage brown burka!” Kellogg screamed into the mike. 

The gunner opened up. The sound of the machine gun rattled through the narrow streets of the small village. 
The driver slammed on the brakes but they were driving too fast and it was already too late. 
The man exploded in a huge fireball barely fifteen feet from the vehicle. 

The force of the explosion threw Kellogg into his jump seat, the concussion and sound of the explosion reached him before the smoke had even begun billowing into the sky. The vehicle slid to a stop in the smoke and dust. Kellogg felt something hard fall against his back and he turned. It was his gunner, Lance Corporal Tucker, and blood was gushing from his neck. His driver, Corporal McDonald’s, head was resting against the steering wheel. Kellogg reached over and felt his pulse. He was alive and breathing just knocked out from the concussion and probably from hitting his head on the steering wheel. Kellogg’s ears were ringing. He could not really hear anything. Then suddenly his hearing returned with a roar. He felt as if he had been hit by a huge wave. 
What is that smell?! 
Kellogg turned to the backseat. Sergeant Chase, the company radio technician, was holding his head. 

What is that noise?

It sounded like someone walking across a bed of soda cans. 

We are under fire! Kellogg realized bile rising in the back of his throat. He suppressed the desire to vomit. 

“Sergeant! Sergeant!” Kellogg screamed shaking Chase’s shoulder. He looked up. “Get on that machine gun NOW!” 

Sergeant Chase stood up and stepped into the turret and turned the machine gun towards the rooftop where they could both clearly see the muzzle flashes and opened up with the .50 cal, the bullets tearing through the mud and brick of the building only thirty feet to their left flank. 

Blazing hot bullet casings began raining down inside the vehicle and burned Kellogg’s neck but he did not attempt to remove them, he was still in shock.
Kellogg ripped open his med kit and tore open the QuickClot Guaze pack and pressed it against his gunners neck. With his free hand he grabbed the radio mic.

“All vics (Marine speak for vehicles) enemy contact my 11o’clock, 10 meters out. Heavy machine gun fire following suicide bomber attack. Break... Blue 4 (which was the tail end vehicle, in the convoy’s, call sign) I need you to push around on the left flank, deploy your fire team to clear. Break.... Blue 3 I have two Marines down bring up the Corpsman. How copy all my last? Over” Kellogg yelled into the radio.

Black 4 copies...

Blue 3 copies... 

Blue 2 copies preparing 9 line Casevac (casualty evacuation).

“Blue 2 be advised two Marines down. One unconscious due to the blast. One is bleeding out. Neck wound. I am applying pressure with QuickClot. Get the fucking Corpsman up here NOW!” 

Blue 4 turned hard off the road into a shallow dry canal. The tires spun throwing up dirt as they fought for traction. The vehicle rammed a mud brick wall on the other side of the canal and it fell as if it were made from toothpicks. The vehicle disappeared into the courtyard. 

Kellogg’s vehicle was filled with smoke burning his eyes. He caught movement out of the corner of his eye and turned to look. It was Blue 4 on the other side of the canal. The Blue 4 gunner was manning a Mark 19, an automatic grenade launcher, and he was pumping high explosive grenades into the building that the machine gun fire was coming from. The fire team deployed from the vehicle firing their personal weapons at the building as they ran for cover. 

Kellogg heard several bangs as the Marines tossed hand grenades into the building. 

Suddenly the back door opened on Kellogg’s M-ATV. It was, HM2 Jones, the platoon’s Corpsman. He climbed in, looked at Tucker for only a second, and then grabbed him by his flak jacket and pulled him from the vehicle. Kellogg turned and reached over the center console and grabbed his driver and pulled him into his lap. Then he opened his door. 

The corpsman was crouched over Tucker who was laying on the ground blood staining the pale sand. Kellogg’s Platoon Sergeant, Staff Sergeant Smith ran over to the open door and grabbed the unconscious Marine in Kellogg’s lap and lowered him to the ground. He was saying something but Kellogg could not make it out with the explosions and machine gun fire. Kellogg reached back into the cab of the M-ATV and pulled out his M4. 

The fire team from Blue 4 stacked up on the front door of the compound where the enemy machine gun fire was coming from, preparing to enter. The gunners continued to rake the top floor with suppressing fire. The fire power was so strong that part of the roof was collapsing because the swiss cheese wall was not able to support its weight. 

Kellogg turned to his Platoon Sergeant, “Cease fire on the suppressing fire so Blue 4 can clear the compound and make damn sure they sweep the entrances for booby-traps.” The unit they had relieved a few months ago had lost three Marines when they set off a booby-trap placed in the doorway of a compound they were clearing. 

“Aye aye Sir.” replied Staff Sergeant Smith as he turned and barked orders to the Marines providing security for the corpsman who was working on Tucker. Two of them stood up and ran to deliver their respective orders.

A few seconds later the machine gun fire stopped and the Black 3 scouts disappeared into the compound. With the machine guns silent the battle space became eerily quite. All the locals had run away even the livestock had run for the hills. A tumble weed blew across the road. 

Kellogg got on the radio “Black 5 (the Company’s Commanding Officers call sign) actual this Blue 1 actual. What is the status of our medevac and support? Over.” 

“Blue 1 this is Black 5 actual be advised the medevac is in route. 15 mikes out. Black 1 & 2 as well as Red 3 are en-route to your poz, 1 mike out. Over.” 

“Copy all Black 5.” There was a flash followed by an explosion inside the compound. 

“Break, break...” yelled Kellogg into the radio. “Blue 4 what is going on in there?” 

After what seemed like an hour but was only about three seconds the radio crackled to life “Booby trap sir. Our flash-bang must have set it off. Compound is clear. Looks like we tore up an IED factory.” 

“Copy Blue 4. How many enemy KIA?” 

“Four sir.”

Kellogg turned to his platoon sergeant. “Staff Sergeant I need you to secure the perimeter. Get me a sniper to provide over-watch on top of that building.” Kellogg said pointing towards the tallest building across the street. “Also we need to get an LZ cleared…” 

“Already done Sir, I had Red 1 clear and hold a field 100 meters down the road and I deployed Blue 2 to the rooftop with the Barrett .50 cal.”

“Thank you Staff Sergeant. Who is going to talk the birds in?” 

“Sergeant Chase, he is on comms with them now.” 

Suddenly there was a horrendous roar. Kellogg spun around just in time to see a Marine Harrier barely a hundred feet above the deck buzz the village passing directly overhead before pulling up into a barrel roll. His wingman was only a few seconds behind. 

The rush of euphoria knowing that air support was on scene, ready to fuck some serious shit up if needed, was very reassuring and Kellogg knew that the enemy had most definitely lost the upper hand. The medevac helicopters crested the top of the nearby mountain. The whoomp whoomp of their rotors cut through the quiet that had descended on the small valley after the Harrier's low pass. They circled the destroyed vehicle, flares spewing as the IED jamming frequencies set off their Surface to Air evasion alarms. Several of the flares struck stands of dry grass starting small fires. The smoke curled in the air as the rotor wash tore through the dust and smoke. The lead Blackhawk landed and Kellogg stooped and grabbed one corner of the stretcher. Staff Sergeant Smith fireman carried the driver who had only just regained consciousness, they were not taking any chances he was going on the bird despite his protests to the contrary. They ran towards the helicopter the sand blasting their faces and the deafening roar of rotors drowning out the screams of the gunner who had woken up. Once Kellogg loaded his two wounded Marines on the Blackhawk he turned around and ran back to his shredded vehicle. He did not get to far before he took a knee, removed his blood soaked kevlar, and vomited into the dust.
