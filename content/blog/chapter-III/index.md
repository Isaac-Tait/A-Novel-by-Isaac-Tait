It was a beautiful day, a bit cloudy, and a chilly storm was blowing in but the lighting was perfect. The mountains were a short drive from the bustling town and it was early in the spring and the alpine meadows had just come alive after being buried under a heavy winters snow. Andor preferred it up here it was much quieter. He had spent his childhood living in a small village in the Cascades and consequently he was not cut out to live in the big city. Everyone bustling about absorbed in their own little worlds. A multitude of little worlds in very close conjunction. Everyone pursuing their dream while surrounded by noise, concrete, crime, disease, and pollution. There was so much stimulation at first it was overwhelming. Andor found it very difficult to feel at ease, at peace. After awhile he began to not notice though and when he realized that he started to worry. That was why he was traipsing through the mountains that day. He needed to unplug, to hear the silence. To remember his roots. Andor stopped frequently to marvel at how the flowers stood out with a new vibrancy against the soil and the way the light caressed the hillside and accentuated her features. He had been here before but with a camera everything looked different; now his thoughts were filled with how to capture the correct perspective and angle to pass on the emotions of the moment onto the observer, something easier said then done. It was a skill he was learning from photography books in his spare time, but not as quickly as he hoped. He was up here not just to unplug but to put his new understanding of F-stops and shutter speed into use. His passion was the mountains the outdoors and he wanted to transport those that viewed his photos to this magical place. Instead he was coming to discover that a vista that looked gorgeous to the mind and seen through his eyes came out bland, boring, and flat once captured on film. Applying perspective and communicating emotion to the “snapshots in time” was an art form that came naturally to some while others spent their whole lives striving for - yet not attaining it. He was beginning to feel that he would be the latter. The gurgling brook emanated from a twisted, contorted, and crumbling cliff surely there was something up there worth photographing. As he pulled his Volkswagen Bus to the side of the highway and parked, he had no idea how right he was. 

Lilli’s day began promptly at 6:30am to the screech of her alarm. She had precisely thirty minutes to shower, eat breakfast, and brush her teeth before running out the door to catch the train to work. She loved trains and always tried to get a window seat so she could watch the world rush by. Once she was at work she would water the twelve plants in her cubicle, making sure they were healthy. Ever since she had been a young girl she had a green thumb. She had started out with her own small garden in her parents backyard, she grew all matter of vegetables, fruits, and herbs often times experimenting with mixed crops and developing greenhouses to facilitate growing crops year round. By the time Lilli was in high school she had started an urban garden in her neighborhood that provided fresh produce for the local food bank while stimulating the economy by creating jobs. Her urban farm model had proven so successful that the city had adopted it and turned multiple empty lots within the city from an eyesore into productive land spaces that rocketed the city into national headlines and consequently the President of the United States had recognized her for her philanthropy with a Volunteer Service Award.  That was a long time ago though, now she was a full time professional at a large corporation in downtown Seattle.

As Andor scrambled up the ravine following the brook towards the waterfall he knew he would be late to work but he had a hunch that just around the bend he would have a great vista for his “perfect” photo. His boss was fairly understanding but just last week had pulled him aside and scolded him.  

“If you miss one more deadline I am going to have let you go” she chided. He knew she was not serious though. 

She could not function without him, they both knew it although she tried to ignore that fact by exercising her authority if only by her slightly higher pay grade. Either way he did not care, when he was outside the voices in his head stopped screaming to be let out. 

The early morning passed as Andor climbed higher and higher stopping to take photos of the waterfall, wildflowers, rock formations, and the various wildlife that had come out to bask in a perfect spring day after a long harsh winter. Andor found a nice spot to rest nestled in a narrow notch of the canyon, the waterfall blocked any further exploration, the rock was polished smooth and the cliff stretched higher than he was comfortable attempting to climb without a rope. Nevertheless the views were incredible and he sat down to soak them in while he ate his breakfast, a pack of Nutter Butters and a Red Bull. Andor glanced at his watch. Dadgumit! 

So much for breakfast. His sunrise hike had taken a little longer than he expected and now he was in danger of being late for the 10am meeting.

It is going to be a long day Lilli thought to herself as she logged on to her computer to find that she had fifty emails waiting in her inbox. Well I have got a few hours till the meeting maybe I can get caught up before then.  

At noon she finally caught up with her emails. 
"Perfect, just in time for lunch." she thought out-loud to herself without noticing.   

Lilli thought to herself as she slid her chair away from her desk and straightened out her ruffled skirt. 
As she was making her way to the kitchen to refill her cold coffee, the cute guy on the other side of the building came storming around the corner and crashed into her spilling her half empty coffee mug all over the floor.

“I am sorry. I did not see you there. I did not spill any on you did I?”

Lilli stammered out a reply, something about it spilling on the carpet and that it was cold anyways. He just smiled and turned hurrying down the hall.

Obviously he is late again. I wonder why…? Lilli thought to herself as she admired him hurrying down the hall. 

He was really late the waterfall had been further away than it looked from the road and consequently he had missed the 10am meeting. He had called in instead but they did not answer. Not a good sign. 

Oh well, I am quitting next month. I cannot wait to be free, to go wherever the wind might take me Andor reminded himself as he dropped his brief case and turned on his computer. There was only one folder in his inbox. Strange. Normally it is chocked full first thing in the morning.
Andor picked it up and smiled. It was a proposal and he did not know the specs the client was requesting. It was his opportunity to talk to the cute girl down the hall. What was her name? Oh yea - Lilli. Right after I finish my coffee I will go over to her cubicle and then I can make a better attempt at apologizing for spilling her coffee all over the floor… Andor thought to himself as he propped his feet up on the desk and began looking over the days emails on his iPhone.

It was a quick glance, a test. To feel the waters if you will. She responded positively and made his heart skip a bit. He had expected a quick glance down, or in any direction for that matter but no, she gazed right back. How long had they known each other but he never noticed how beautiful her dark brown eyes were. It was a professional exchange, there were to many people around who would start gossiping about them in the break room. Andor made his way over to where she was standing by the 30th floor window. The conversation flowed naturally, no awkward pauses or uncertainty. They just kept talking, never skipping a bit. It became apparent both of them at almost the same instant that the other was not happy with where their lives were. The same job every day, the same cubicle, the same commute to work, the same computer password, the same mindless banter over the phone. 

“Good morning so and so, how are you?”

“I am fine and you?” 

“I am fine. Hey I have a question for you....”

It made him sick hearing and asking the same question everyday without caring and knowing the voice on the other end did not care either. 
Standing in front of him was something refreshing. A petite brunette with the slightest hint of a tan. Her smile was deep, captivating, and real. They had real conversation, there was genuine interest. Connection. Honesty. It was refreshing.

Why would she be interested in me? 
This thought raced through his mind, over and over as he watched her lips. It was so damn loud in this staff “party” the only way he could tell what she was saying was to read her lips. 

She is not wearing lipstick and yet her lips look... How do they look?
He had never tried to describe a woman's lips before, they had always just been there. He was more interested in other regions and not just the obvious ones, but a nose and ears were important to him. He had dated a girl who looked gorgeous when viewed straight in the face but from the side her face completely changed and try as hard as he could he just could not bring himself to like her face from the side. 

I have never seen her from the side have I?

It was nearly five and normally they would have excused themselves. Neither wanted to stay one minute past five. He kept waiting for her to say “Well I should go.” But she did not and so they continued to stand there chatting, smiling, and gazing into one anothers' eyes. Her cheeks look so soft.
She looked at her watch, it was a stunning time piece. A victorian era looking locket hanging on a very nice looking chain. 
She is looking at her watch. I have made her uncomfortable, she probably got creeped out by my prolonged eye contact. I should excuse myself.... God am I a creeper!? 
Then without really thinking he blurted out the first thing that came to his mind to keep the conversation going. He did not want her to leave just yet.

“That is a lovely time piece.” as he involuntarily extends his hand, in an offering to take a closer look. 

“My fiancee gave it to me.” she said as she handed it to him. 

And with those six words he remembered a conversation they had had several months before. He had come by her office to drop off some important paperwork. He had not intended to come see her but she was the only one in the department when he stopped by. Plus she was new and he was sure she would not be of much help. His hunch was right, she was not much help but he stayed and they kept talking about all kinds of things. He had sat on the edge of her desk to get more comfortable. The conversation wandered, it was like they were good friends and yet they had just met. He enjoyed the conversation. It was so nice to connect on deeper level than he was used to at work. It was not flirtatious, at least he was not intending to come across as such. He was just enjoying the real conversation. Then she reached for the watch, which was resting on her desk, and began rubbing it in her hands like a worry stone. She mentioned those same six words and then the conversation died. It was as if someone had opened a door and an unexpected gust of wind had extinguished a candle. It was awkward in fact, so much so that he stood up and said he should get back to the office and came up with a half baked excuse as to why. 
This time, at the staff party it was different, their conversation did not die. Quite the opposite happened in fact. She moved in just a little closer, hardly noticeable to an outside observer just close enough that he noticed she was just inside the unspoken personal space given to those that you worked with. 

Why is she so comfortable with me?

Maybe it was his comment at the start of the “party” about her “cute jacket” - which he kicked himself mentally for saying as soon as he uttered it. He had not meant anything by it but still he did not want her filing a sexual harassment complaint against him. 
In that horrific sexual harassment video Human Resources had made him watch when he was hired someone in the video had made a similar comment and had gotten in a lot of trouble. When he said it though she did not skip a beat, in fact her face lit up when she said thank you. 
When he took the locket in his hand he realized that they were crossing a line. A line that had always scared him to even to think about crossing. That is when he looked her in in the eyes and she did not look away. It was real, it was scary, and it made him feel alive. Something that he had not felt in a very long time. Especially at work. 

“He passed away three years ago.” Lilli said as a tear rolled down her cheek. Then she turned and left the room without retrieving the watch which was still in Andor's outstretched hand.

He was going to miss it up here, the top of the mountain was devoid of trees and the slopes were covered in talus interspersed with small patches of sage brush and wind swept pines. The views stretched for hundreds of miles. It was a beautiful day. The temperature was a perfect seventy-five, the sun was poking through puffy white clouds, the wind was blowing the scent of pine and dust and about a thousand feet at the base of the mountain there was a small lake. The lake was fed by springs deep within the mountains and at its southern tip it spilled out into a small brook that meandered through a small alpine valley for about a mile before flinging itself over a two hundred foot precipice catching the wind and becoming a glorious rainbow, a sign of a promise made long ago. You could see all this from the top of the mountain it was beautiful up here on top of the mountain next to his lake. Andor thought back to the first time he had climbed this mountain over fifteen years ago. It would be the last time for a long time that he would be able to come up here.  

He sat down on a boulder that had been carved by wind and time into a very comfortable seat. He tried to think back to the last time he had come up here but it had been so long ago that it just blended together into a congealed mass. He wondered how long it would be before he came up here again. 
You never know about life, where it can take you. Andor thought to himself. Just two years ago he was planning on quitting his job to be a nomad and live out of his van but then he had met Lilli and almost overnight his priorities had shifted. He did not quit his job right away like he had planed. Much to his surprise he decided to become a U.S. Marine Corps officer. He and Lilli had just gotten married less than a month ago, and now he was headed off to Quantico, Virginia for Marine Corps Officer Candidate School.Leaving one home and traveling to the next. It was an exciting time.
